## 1. Overview <a name="Overview"></a>
The GameBoy Console is an emulator that plays physical GameBoy, GameBoy Color and GameBoy Advance cartridges on your TV! The goal of this project is to provide an inexpensive solution for revisiting beloved GameBoy games on the big screen and help preserve cartridge save data. Additionally, the system hardware supports connecting to the [Wireless Gameboy Controller](https://shop.insidegadgets.com/product/wireless-gameboy-controller//) cartridge to enable playing on your TV while using your Gameboy as a controller!

### Connecting Cartridges <a name="Overview_ConnectingCartridges"></a>
The cartridge connector supports GameBoy, GameBoy Color and GameBoy Advance cartridges. Only when the status LED is on is the cartridge receiving power. When the status LED is off, you are free to connect and disconnect cartridges. The system runs on a syncing concept where cartridges are cloned onto the system and put into a virtual catalog. The cartridge then no longer needs to be connected to play and only needs to be connected to transfer updated save data back to the cartridge. Similarly, if cartridge save data has been updated, running the sync process allows for the system save data to be updated to the cartridge state.

### Hardware Layout <a name="Overview_HardwareLayout"></a>
The GameBoy Console is powered by a Raspberry Pi zero. A connected SD card contains the operating system and stores all data of the backed up cartridges for the catalog. Refer to the following diagram for locating the Status LED, Power/Bluetooth Button, Micro USB power connector, Micro USB peripheral port and Mini HDMI port.

<img alt="Sync Dialog" src="img/case_diagram.jpg" width="400"/>

### Power On/Off <a name="Overview_PowerOnOff"></a>
The GameBoy Console should boot up when the power is first plugged in. To quickly and easily shut down the system, hold down the button on the front of the case. Once shutdown, simply press the front button to have the system boot up again. Additionally, you can manually shutdown from the system menu by selecting the shutdown icon <img src="img/icon_power.png" width="18"/> at the top of the system menu. You will then be prompted to confirm you want to shut down the system. Failing to shutdown the system safely could result in corruption of the SD card and potential loss of data.

<img alt="Shutdown Dialog" src="img/dialog_shutdown.png" width="500"/>

### BIOS Files <a name="Overview_BIOSFiles"></a>
Currently, fast GameBoy Advance emulation requires that you provide a GBA bios file. This file should be named "gba_bios.bin" and placed at the root of a connected USB drive or on the SD card boot partition. On boot, the GameBoy Console will look for this file and copy it to the system if it is found. Once copied, the file no longer needs to be on the USB drive or SD card boot partition.

## 2. Controls <a name="Controls"></a>
The GameBoy Console supports the following controller options.

### Keyboard <a name="Controls_Keyboard"></a>
<img src="img/controller_keyboard.jpg" width="400"/>

The most straight forward controller option is a standard keyboard connected to the USB port. Refer to the following chart for the keyboard key mapping.

| Up       | Down       | Left       | Right       | Select      | Start | A     | B     | L     | R     |
|:-------- |:---------- |:---------- |:----------- |:----------- |:----- |:----- |:----- |:----- |:----- |
| Up Arrow | Down Arrow | Left Arrow | Right Arrow | Right Shift | Enter | X Key | Z Key | Q Key | W Key |

*Hotkeys*

| Exit | Save Slot Increase | Save Slot Decrease | Save State | Load State | Fast Forward | Pause |
|:---- |:------------------ |:------------------ |:---------- |:---------- |:------------ |:----- |
| Esc  | F7                 | F6                 | F2         | F4         | Space        | P Key | 

### 8BitDo <a name="Controls_8bitdo"></a>
<img src="img/controller_8bitdo.jpg" width="400"/>

Currently, the only controllers supported are the [SN30](https://www.8bitdo.com/sn30-gp/) and [SN30 Pro](https://www.8bitdo.com/sn30-pro-g-classic-or-sn30-pro-sn/) from 8BitDo. These can be plugged into the USB port or optionally connected via bluetooth (see [Settings](#Settings_Bluetooth)). Holding the X key enables the use of the following hotkeys.

| Exit    | Save Slot Increase | Save Slot Decrease | Save State | Load State | Fast Forward | Pause    |
|:------- |:------------------ |:------------------ |:---------- |:---------- |:------------ |:-------- |
| X+Start | X+Right            | X+Left             | X+Up       | X+Down     | X+A          | X+Select |


### Wireless Gameboy Controller <a name="Controls_WirelessGameReceiver"></a>
<img src="img/controller_wirelessgameboycontroller.jpg" width="400"/>

The GameBoy Console also supports connecting to the [Wireless Gameboy Controller](https://shop.insidegadgets.com/product/wireless-gameboy-controller//) from insideGadgets. Make sure the controller is set to its defaults and it should connect automatically. Hotkeys can only be used from a different connected controller or keyboard. To exit a game with this controller, simply hold down A+B+L+R+Start+Select.

## 3. Cartridge <a name="Cartridge"></a>
The cartridge section of the menu can be opened by selecting the blue cartridge icon <img src="img/icon_cartridge.png" width="18"/> at the top of the system menu. This is the main section for performing actions with physically connected cartridges *(note that you are free to connect and disconnect cartridges from the system as long as the status LED is not on)*. From here you can perform the following operations.

<img alt="Cartridge Screen" src="img/screen_cartridge.png" width="700"/>

### Load <a name="Cartridge_Load"></a>
When this section is first opened, the system will attempt to identify the connected cartridge. If recognized, the system will provide box art and screen captures from the game. The refresh icon <img src="img/icon_refresh.png" width="18"/> can be selected at any time to re check the connected cartridge.

If this is a new cartridge, the game data and save data will both be backed up to the system. If this is a cartridge that the system has already backed up, syncing will attempt to copy the system save data state to the cartridge. If the cartridge save data has been updated since the last sync, you will be prompted on whether you want to update the system or update the cartridge.

<img alt="Sync Dialog" src="img/dialog_sync.png" width="500"/>
